I love using ReSharper and 0xDBE (possibly the number two application in my toolbox), but it will be hard to justify this to management.  If you offered a perpetual license after 12 months, or kept both SAAS and the perceptual license(you could charge quite a bit more in this case) it would be excellent.<p>Edit: If you charged me 10 bucks a month for 0xDBE I wouldnt be able to get it approved even on a good day.

10167499,comment,10167011,10167338,0,0,tinco,,,"XML databases actually got to be amazing, if that was his prediction he would have been totally right. The fact is that they just got amazing a little bit too late. No one is going to consider an XML database because XML got a bad reputation (and rightly so).<p>But XML database technology actually has nothing to do with XML. The idea is that you store nested data nodes. Imagine you have a mongodb collection, and in it you have documents, and each of those documents would also be a mongodb collection in which you could insert more documents. You can build full graphs like that, and if you allow references to nodes those graphs can be cyclic too. Pretty powerful right?<p>Now you might say yeah of course, but that&#x27;s got to be crazy slow! And at the time Yegge made his prediction you would have been right. But then academics came into the scene, they developed data structures and algorithms that allow you to store these recursively nested documents in column stores (think SQL table with 2 columns, a primary key and a piece of data) in such a genius way that you can make whatever query you can think of (recursive, joins, whatever) and execute them almost as fast as any indexed search query.<p>That magic happens, and is implemented for example in MonetDB/XQuery which sadly got abandoned a few years ago.<p>I still think if a crazy person sets off to go build a database company (crazy people like that seem to be quite popular in SV these days) they could make a lot of money forking MonetDB/XQuery, and search-replaceing every instance of X with J and every instance of XML with JSON. Crazier still, you can even let MonetDB/XQuery results be formatted as json, even before MongoDB became popular I think.",1441313937
10167498,comment,10163916,10167441,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"I understood your point.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  And I&#x27;ve seen multiple people (including MMM) make that same point in several different places; nor am I relying only on one source for advice.  (Though if you&#x27;re suggesting it has <i>no</i> predictive power for long-term averages, that&#x27;s ridiculous; it&#x27;s simply that predictions are not in any way guarantees, nor do they in any way let you time the market.)<p>But even if you don&#x27;t buy into the 4% rate, or even if you want to make a more conservative assumption, the math for an estimate still works; just use a different multiplier.  And you <i>still</i> shouldn&#x27;t treat that estimate as a guarantee.  Retirement doesn&#x27;t need to be a binary one-way process, where once you retire if you didn&#x27;t plan well enough you&#x27;re doomed.  One of the lovely advantages of retiring early is that you&#x27;re still more than capable of working <i>if you want to</i>, or doing some other kind of work.<p>Nor should you assume that because you planned for 4% (or 3%, or whatever you like), you should withdraw that much like clockwork every year.  You might plan for 4%, but then spend 2.5% because that&#x27;s what you happened to need.  And if the market happens to grow 10% in a year, great, but you shouldn&#x27;t spend 2.5x as much that year.  Whatever you don&#x27;t spend stays in place, growing your buffer even more for future downsides.  If you steal away every unexpected upside, averages stop working, and you&#x27;ll be more screwed by unexpected downsides rather than just living a little more frugally for a while.<p>Estimates are just that: estimates.  They&#x27;re useful tools for planning, not guarantees.<p>Again, see the article I linked about safety margins.  You&#x27;re talking all about all the horrible things that could happen.  So, have backup plans, and backup backup plans, and you <i>still</i> can retire before your 60s.",1441313904
10167497,comment,10164626,10167391,0,0,kazinator,,,"In this case, it may be. The territory is never observed other than through maps, and the maps are all math. That is to say, the maps may be of the same &quot;stuff&quot; as the territory, and as the differences between the maps and the territory are erased, eventually you arrive at the map being the territory.<p>At least, they are all math beyond those subjective observations that are possible through the human senses. You might think that some hot gas is &quot;glowing blue&quot;, and that this is not &quot;math&quot; to you in any sense, but a more advanced understanding of the light emanating from it gives us a spectrum, and that is just a math function.<p>Of course when we look at an actual map of some place, we know that the place isn&#x27;t a picture with symbols denoting its features. It&#x27;s not so clear for features of the universe. When you&#x27;re far from the bottom, the descriptions look like maps. The mass and acceleration arrows on a free body diagram of an automobile aren&#x27;t the automobile; it&#x27;s all just a diagram.<p>But the more detailed you make the description of something, the less of a distinction there is between the description and the thing! At some point, the description must be the thing. (If it isn&#x27;t then just alter whatever is different between the two and patch the description; then repeat.)<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that math <i>itself</i> has map/territory descriptions. The formula or graph representing a mathematical object isn&#x27;t that object.<p>When we say that the universe may just be math, we don&#x27;t mean that the written math is the universe, but rather that the abstract math described by those representations is identifiable with what is real: the map isn&#x27;t the territory, but those two territories are identifiable with each other!",1441313897

I do not understand the meaning of backtest overfitting. If a strategy worked in the past, why shouldn’t it work in the future? Could you please provide a simple example?<p>> Any random sample extracted from a population incorporates patterns. For example, after tossing a fair coin ten times we could obtain by chance a sequence such as {+,+,+,+,+,-,-,-,-,-}, where “+” means head and “-” means tail. A researcher could determine that the best strategy for betting on the outcomes of this coin is to expect “+” on the first five tosses, and for “-” on the last five tosses (a typical “seasonal” argument in the investment community). When we toss that coin ten more times, we may obtain a sequence such as {-,-,+,-,+,+,-,-,+,-}, where we win 5 times and lose 5 times. That researcher’s betting rule was overfit, because it was designed to profit from a random pattern observed in the past. The rule has absolutely no predictive power over the future, regardless of how well it appears to have worked in the past.<p><a href=""http://blogs.barrons.com/focusonfunds/2014/06/13/backtests-damned-backtests-and-statistics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.barrons.com/focusonfunds/2014/06/13/backtests-d...</a><p>> The point: Investors don’t know how many hypotheses the managers examined, didn’t like, and chucked out, before they found the perfect backtest.

But I believe the proposition is to charge it on the value of the <i>land</i>, not including the value of the improvements, which is typically a much lower number. For single family homes it would still be a hit, but not as severe as your math indicates. For higher density developments it would be even less onerous - which is pretty much the point.<p>Tangentially, I believe your estimate on ROI from rentals is inaccurate. Long term average stock returns are in the range of 7%, it&#x27;s not uncommon to find rentals about 10%.

Often, in brains and bodies in general, the same mechanism causes more than one result.  Sometimes even the absence of the mechanism causes the same result too.  Biological understanding has a high number of latent variables we may not even know exist.  (plus, arguing &quot;because biology&quot; is just a few steps away from arguing &quot;because quantum&quot; when motivated by vague optimism.)<p>The best <i>overall</i> insight from neuroscience is: AI, as envisioned by the 1950s pioneers, is possible.  Brains are complex, but not irreducibly complex. Just slam some gametes together and a new brain appears.  We can, at some level, eventually, get it all working digitally.<p>The best <i>useful</i> insight from neuroscience seems to be: the never-ending a/b test of natural selection converged on neurons+synapses as a universal computation system.  But, neurons+synapses aren&#x27;t quite enough detail to replicate a brain—that&#x27;s like saying our computers use transistors, so all we need is transistors to build a CPU.  Sure, that&#x27;s important, but the structure and topology and interconnections are what make the magic happens.<p>What&#x27;s the end result?  More design or more brute force?  Our GPUs are still Moore&#x27;s Lawing themselves every few years.  We are in early days of experimentation-at-scale here.<p>Since we will always need an overwhelmingly higher number of model parameters than data, we can&#x27;t intricately tune models by hand (alternative: make an ANN to optimize ANN architectures).  One breakthrough we don&#x27;t really have is a minimum-description for ANN architectures.  If that were to come about, we could have &quot;ANN DNA&quot; then &#x27;breed&#x27; ANNs together so their topologies and functions merge to generate a (hopefully) more fit offspring.
